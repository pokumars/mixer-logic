## Introduction
[Mixer-logic](#) is a webpage (SPA) that can be used to search for different cocktails and their recipes. The search can be done based on name, method and in the future what alcohols it contains.

## How to use?
On the page, the user selects what criteria they want to search by, name or method, and they type in their search query into the search bar and voil√†, cocktail results. 
There is a randomly generated list of featured drinks whenever there has been no search done or there were no results returned for what the user searched.

## Motivation
 I decided I needed to build more personal projects to get better at the tools
 and frameworks that are used in the industry.

In the winter of 2020 I was on exchange in Glasgow, my third year of university,
and looking for internships back in Helsinki while COVID-19 raged on. Despite
it being in the tech industry, it was difficult as I was not physically present 
to do some of the recruiting events the companies had organised. With some 
other companies, I made it quite far in their recruitment processes but failed
at the last hurdles. I could not get an internship software development. I had
to get demonstrably better.

I decided to make this web application because I realised that I had not done
many personal projects. I had not come across many things that I was really 
interested in building until I found one beautifully designed magazine/booklet
by [Finlandia Vodka](https://www.finlandia.com/en/) with cocktail recipes. I decided to turn that into a web page.
