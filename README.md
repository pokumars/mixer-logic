## Introduction
[Mixer-logic](http://mixer-logic.surge.sh) is a webpage (SPA) that can be used to search for different cocktails and their recipes. The search can be done based on name, method and in the future what alcohols it contains.

[Static Frontend on AWS](https://completephase1.dw8oebx33y2ox.amplifyapp.com/)

## How to use?
On the page, the user selects what criteria they want to search by, name or method, and they type in their search query into the search bar and voil√†, cocktail results. 
There is a randomly generated list of featured drinks whenever there has been no search done or there were no results returned for what the user searched.

## Motivation
 I decided I needed to build more personal projects to get better at the tools
 and frameworks that are used in the industry.

In the winter of 2020 I was on exchange in Glasgow, my third year of university,
and looking for internships back in Helsinki while COVID-19 raged on. Despite
it being in the tech industry, it was difficult as I was not physically present 
to do some of the recruiting events the companies had organised. Another 
difficulty I believe was my unfamiliarity with some of the tools and frameworks
currently being used in in the industry such as React, redux etc- basically I 
was not yet good enough. With some other companies, I made it quite far in their
recruitment processes but failed at the last hurdles. I could not get an 
internship software development. I had to get demonstrably better.

I had to build more projects. I decided to make this web application because I 
realised that I had not done many personal projects. I had not come across many 
things that I was really interested in building until I found one beautifully 
designed magazine/booklet by [Finlandia Vodka](https://www.finlandia.com/en/) with cocktail recipes. I decided to turn that into a web page.
